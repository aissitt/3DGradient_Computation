# 3DGradient_Computation
This repository contains a benchmarking framework for computing gradients of 3D velocity data. It compares the performance of CPU and GPU implementations for gradient computation using NumPy and CuPy. The primary focus is on evaluating execution times, GFLOPS, and speedups for varying sample sizes.
